Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and classifying subjective information in text data. This might be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or product feature.

The most common type of sentiment analysis is ‘polarity detection’ and involves classifying statements as positive, negative or neutral.

Twitter allows businesses to engage personally with consumers. However, there’s so much data on Twitter that it can be hard for brands to prioritize mentions that could harm their business.

In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Twitter Sentiment dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of 100 % using the Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier which is quite well for the given Brazil Fires dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot  Pairplot , Jointplot etc.
